## 6. Risk Assessment

Risk# 1: There could be little resistance to the new system as the users in those areas of India are not accustomed to shopping online for fresh produce

Likelihood of the risk:
Very less likely. Per the statistics and surveys, people are already familiar with online shopping. So, there is very little chance that the idea of this website 
would face resistance.

Potential impact on the project:
As this is an introductory step, there could be some friction from customers to acclimatize to it. However, DPP still has its trusted and strong client base who order
in person and over phone calls. So, it wouldn’t be of a large impact on the business. 

Ways to address the risk:
●	DPP could come up with promotional offers on purchases on the website. This could include coupons, discounts, and gifts for purchases in the first couple of months.
●	They could start educating their customers about the new feature they developed and encourage them to use it. 
●	They could start smart marketing by advertising over TV, billboards, radio, etc., so people are informed.


Risk #2: There are chances for the website to crash in cases of heavy traffic.

Likelihood of the risk:
Although an enthusiastic response from customers is expected, it is not very likely that the system would crash. The system would be designed well to handle huge traffics. 

Potential impact on the project:
The impact of this risk would be that the customers using the site during the crash may lose their shopping progress. This might create a bad user experience. 

Ways to address the risk:
•	The site should be designed and developed to be glitch free. 
•	Also, DPP could analyze their user volume and come up with estimates of times when the site would face a lot of traffic and be prepared for it with extra measures. 

Risk #3: Payment Gateway may cause issues

Likelihood of the risk:
Very less likely. As it is a third-party vendor provided feature, there would be strict contract rules about the availability of the system.

Potential impact on the project:
Not much of an impact as this is a very unlikely situation. If it does occur, the customer would be charged money without the order being placed. Or the customer may 
lose the progress of the payment method data and must re-enter it.

Ways to address the risk:
●	Strict guidelines need to be placed with the vendor about the availability of the payment system
●	Bank accounts are cross-checked in regular intervals daily to identify such faulty transactions.

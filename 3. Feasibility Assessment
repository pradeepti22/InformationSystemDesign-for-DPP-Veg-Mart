## 3. Feasibility Assessment

Feasibility Analysis Assessment Factors	
Technical Feasibility: Can We Build It?
Consider:	
• Familiarity with application: Less familiarity generates more risk.
• Familiarity with technology: Less familiarity generates more risk.
• Project size: Large projects have more risk.	
• Compatibility: The harder it is to integrate the system with the company’s existing technology, the higher the risk will be.

4.1	Technical Feasibility
Familiarity with the application
As DPP is building a website for the first time, the users are not familiar with the application/ website. However, considering this is to be a progressive step for the
business, the benefits outweigh this risk. The business value brought in by the site would encourage the users to use this feature. Compared to the traditional methods
of selling, this would be a step forward. Except in agricultural products, there are a lot of e-commerce and online shopping business websites operating in Maharashtra 
and the neighboring states of India. Owing to this fact, it would be a dynamic step for DPP to launch the first website in their area of business. 

Familiarity with the technology
Most of the users are already familiar with shopping online and interacting with websites. Upon surveying, DPP found that most of the users in the vicinity are savvy 
with the websites and other related technology. Hence, there shouldn't be difficulty for the users to use the site.

Project Size
The project is first targeted to be implemented in a mid-level scale in select areas where there is a strong customer base. This ensures that a larger risk is not 
taken by implementing a complex and big project.

Compatibility
There is no existing technology or legacy system available for DPP as a firm. This offers greater freedom in terms of compatibility. With no old systems, hardware, 
software or programs in place, this is a clean slate to start with. The new website doesn’t have to deal with any additional programming for integration or compatibility.

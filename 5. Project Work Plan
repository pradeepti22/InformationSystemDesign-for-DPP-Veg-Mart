##5.	Project Work Plan 
1	Planning Phase
The planning phase is the first phase of developing the system. During this phase, we understood why this system should be built and came up with a high-level plan of how to
start the project. The main outcomes of the Planning phase are a System Request, Feasibility analysis, Risk Assessment, and a Project Work Plan. 

2	Analysis Phase
During the Analysis phase, we understood who will use the system, what will the system do, where and when it will be used. The main outcomes of this phase 
include a revised Project work plan, Requirements definition statement, Use cases, Process models and Data Models.

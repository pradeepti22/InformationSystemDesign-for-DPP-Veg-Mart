How DPP Veg Mart Works
DPP Veg Mart specializes in offering both seasonal and non-seasonal fruits/ vegetables. As there is no chain of middlemen between the producer (Farmer) and consumer, 
both the parties get good value for the products. Also, fruits and vegetables require special handling. To preserve quality and maintain marketability, each crop must 
be harvested, prepared for market, packaged, and shipped promptly. Transportation of the vegetables is managed according to the specific needs and priorities. 
Either farmers or other sources can transport them or DPP Veg Mart would send their own transport to get the vegetables at the client’s doorstep. The latter is the preferred 
method because of the challenge’s other sources face in transportation. 

Upon arrival, the produce is stored in the company warehouses which operate in a hierarchy of 3 levels. The First level is the Central Hub (CH in the corporate office), 
then comes the Sub Center Hub (SCH) and then the clients (users, traders). Pictorial representation of the same could be found in Figure 2 in Page 5. 

SCHs are usually bombarded with bulk orders. In case of shortage of supplies, the SCHs promptly order the CH on re-stocking. Based on the locations, in times of priority, 
the SCHs fetch their produce from other SCHs or directly from farmers too. In this way, the SCHs communicate with each other through CH or amongst themselves.
                        
All the Legal, economic and management decisions are taken by the Corporate Hub head office. The success factors for DPP Veg Mart has been the elimination of middlemen, 
seamless delivery of the produce and management of the vendors. The farmers get good value for their products and the vendors and happy with the glitch-free work flow.
